# Classic Cryptography

This is a collection of scripts, tools, and code fragments that attempt to implement classic encipherment methods. It includes functions to encrypt and/or decrypt using versions of the Caesar Cipher, Belaso Cipher (often referred to as the Vigenere cipher), a simple transposition cipher, and one of my own that simply shifts text based on unicode codes (it's just a Caesar Cipher with a much larger character set). There is also a script that creates a one-time pad and enciphers and deciphers a message using that pad. In addition, there are some helper functions that create contact maps and extract bigrams and trigrams.
